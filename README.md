This repository contains tables extracted from the `<LocalLowFolder>/master/master.mdb` file. 

The `meta` folder contains tables extracted from the `<LocalLowFolder>/meta` (Manifest) file.

Tables are available in CSV, JSON and SQL formats. In CSV the columns are in the correct order, but in JSON the keys are forced to be in alphabetical order.

The SQL format is directly copying the original file. Uploaded for backup.
